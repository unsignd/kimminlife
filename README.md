# DATA RADAR: KIM MINCHEOL (kimmin)

An interface-based experiential simulation for observing
behavioral persistence, leverage exposure, and outcome
accumulation through the assumed life of
Data Radar Kim Mincheol.

## ABSTRACT

This website presents a constrained trading simulation framed
not as a tool, game, or benchmark, but as an experiential
environment.

Participants are not positioned as independent users.
Instead, they are invited to temporarily inhabit the role of
Data Radar Kim Mincheol (kimmin) and operate within a fixed
set of market and interface conditions.

The project does not attempt to evaluate market efficiency,
forecast returns, or validate trading strategies.
Its purpose is observational: to document how outcomes emerge
when leverage, parameters, and scope are held constant while
decision-making continues.

1. BACKGROUND

---

Retail trading platforms typically emphasize personalization:
adjustable leverage, configurable indicators, flexible risk
controls, and strategy-driven narratives.

These affordances encourage post-hoc interpretation of results,
often attributing outcomes to unrealized alternatives.

This project intentionally removes such affordances.

By fixing parameters and centering the experience on a named
individual, the interface reframes trading as a condition
rather than a sequence of optimizable choices.

2. SUBJECT FRAMING

---

The simulator is explicitly centered on a single identity:
Data Radar Kim Mincheol (kimmin).

This framing is not cosmetic.

All interactions are contextualized as actions taken by
Kim Mincheol, not by an abstract or interchangeable user.
The system does not provide mechanisms to distance outcomes
from the subject through configuration or role ambiguity.

Responsibility is treated as continuous and cumulative.

3. EXPERIENCE MODEL

---

Upon entering the interface, the participant assumes the role
of Kim Mincheol without prompt or confirmation.

There is no character creation, onboarding, or role selection.
The premise is fixed.

The experience is designed to resemble routine rather than
event-based decision-making, emphasizing repetition,
exposure, and accumulation over discrete wins or losses.

4. SYSTEM SCOPE

---

The system operates strictly at the interface and presentation
layer.

- No live market connectivity
- No real execution or settlement
- No external data dependencies beyond price feeds
- No persistence beyond simulated state

Actions are accepted and reflected visually.
Outcomes are displayed as interface state changes.
No claims of realism beyond representation are made.

5. MARKET PARAMETERS

---

Instrument: MOODENGUSDT (Perpetual Futures)
Leverage: 2× (fixed, non-adjustable)
Liquidation Threshold: -50%
Initial Virtual Balance: $200

These parameters are immutable by design.
They serve as experimental constants rather than user options.

Constraint is treated as an analytical tool.

6. INTERFACE ARCHITECTURE

---

6.1 Market Overview - Mark price - Fair price - 24-hour high and low

6.2 Chart Module - Candlestick visualization - Exponential Moving Averages
(EMA 5 / 10 / 20 / 200)

6.3 Execution Layer - Buy / Sell actions - Quantity input - Estimated exposure and position value

6.4 State Representation - Current balance - Holdings - Order history

The interface prioritizes transparency of state while
intentionally limiting control over structure.

7. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

---

Where many financial interfaces aim to empower, this system
aims to expose.

By removing configurability, the simulator reduces the space
for counterfactual reasoning (“If leverage were different…”,
“If position sizing were adjusted…”).

What remains is a narrower, more interpretable relationship
between decision frequency, exposure, and outcome.

8. PERFORMANCE RECORD

---

The following section is reserved for empirical documentation
produced during the experience.

This space accepts visual evidence only.
No interpretation is provided by the system.

The presence of evidence does not imply skill.
The absence of evidence does not require explanation.

9. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

Frontend: React
Styling: Dark, exchange-referential layout
Charting: Lightweight candlestick renderer with EMA overlays
Deployment: Vercel

The implementation favors clarity and restraint over feature
completeness.

10. LIMITATIONS

---

- No order book or market depth simulation
- No latency, slippage, or funding rate modeling
- No statistical validation of outcomes
- No generalization beyond the defined role and parameters

Observed results are local to this system and this identity.

11. ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL DISCLAIMERS

---

This website does not execute real trades.
No real assets or funds are involved.
Nothing presented constitutes financial advice.

Any resemblance to real trading behavior is observational,
not prescriptive.

The system records interactions.
External markets record consequences.

12. CONCLUSION

---

When identity is fixed and parameters are constrained,
outcomes become attributable rather than debatable.

This project exists to make that attribution visible,
boring, and difficult to ignore.

It is not about winning.
It is about observing what persists.

This is the experience of
Data Radar, Kimmin.
