# KIMMIN LIFE

An interface-based experiential simulation for observing
behavioral persistence, leverage exposure, and outcome
accumulation through the assumed life of Kimmin.

## ABSTRACT

This website presents a constrained trading simulation framed
as an experiential system titled “Kimmin Life.”

The project is centered on a single implied subject,
Kim Mincheol (hereafter referred to as Kimmin),
and invites participants to temporarily inhabit this role.

The system does not aim to evaluate market efficiency,
predict returns, or validate trading strategies.
Its purpose is observational: to document how outcomes
accumulate over time when identity, leverage, and parameters
are held constant.

1. SUBJECT DEFINITION

---

Kim Mincheol is introduced once as the real-world referent
for the simulated identity Kimmin.

All subsequent references operate exclusively through
the name Kimmin.

The simulator does not support alternative identities.
The subject is fixed.
Responsibility is continuous.

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAME

---

Kimmin Life is not a trading tool and not a game in the
traditional sense.

It is an experiential framing device.

Participants do not configure an account or select a role.
They enter directly into an assumed condition:
the ongoing trading life of Kimmin.

Actions are treated as habitual rather than exceptional.

3. MOTIVATION

---

Most retail trading interfaces emphasize customization,
encouraging users to attribute outcomes to adjustable
parameters rather than to behavior.

Kimmin Life removes this layer entirely.

By fixing leverage, liquidation thresholds, and market scope,
the system collapses optionality and foregrounds exposure.

4. SYSTEM SCOPE

---

The system operates strictly at the interface layer.

- No live market execution
- No real asset exposure
- No matching or settlement engine
- No persistence beyond simulated state

Inputs are registered.
State is updated.
No claims of realism beyond representation are made.

5. MARKET PARAMETERS

---

Instrument: MOODENGUSDT (Perpetual Futures)
Leverage: 2× (fixed)
Liquidation Threshold: -50%
Initial Virtual Balance: $200

These parameters are immutable.
They function as experimental constants.

6. EXPERIENCE MODEL

---

Upon entry, the interface assumes the identity of Kimmin
without confirmation or onboarding.

There is no beginning and no end state.
The experience is designed to resemble routine rather
than isolated decision-making.

Time, repetition, and accumulation are emphasized over
individual outcomes.

7. INTERFACE ARCHITECTURE

---

7.1 Market Overview - Mark price - Fair price - 24-hour high and low

7.2 Chart Module - Candlestick visualization - Exponential Moving Averages
(EMA 5 / 10 / 20 / 200)

7.3 Action Layer - Buy / Sell actions - Quantity input - Estimated exposure

7.4 State Representation - Balance - Holdings - Order history

Information is fully visible.
Structural control is intentionally absent.

8. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

---

Where most interfaces aim to empower,
Kimmin Life aims to constrain.

By eliminating configurability, the system reduces
counterfactual reasoning and reframes outcomes as
direct consequences of continued behavior.

Discomfort is not an error condition.

9. PERFORMANCE RECORD

---

The following section is reserved for empirical documentation
generated during the experience.

No interpretation is provided by the system.

10. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

Frontend: React
Styling: Dark, exchange-referential layout
Charting: Lightweight candlestick renderer with EMA overlays
Deployment: Vercel

The implementation favors restraint over completeness.

11. LIMITATIONS

---

- No order book or market depth simulation
- No latency, slippage, or funding-rate modeling
- No statistical validation of outcomes

Observed results do not generalize beyond this system
and this identity.

12. DISCLAIMER

---

Kimmin Life does not execute real trades.
No real assets or funds are involved.
Nothing presented constitutes financial advice.

The interface records interactions.
External markets record consequences.

13. CONCLUSION

---

When identity is fixed and parameters are constrained,
outcomes become attributable rather than negotiable.

Kimmin Life exists to make that attribution visible,
repetitive, and difficult to ignore.

This is not a question of winning.
It is a documentation of persistence.
